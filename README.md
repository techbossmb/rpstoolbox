Toolbox for Reconstructed Phase Space used in my Thesis.
This is part of the semi-supervised pattern recognition algorithm I developed to identify extreme (temporal pattern ) cold events in natural gas data. 
Phase space reconstruction allows me to perform a low-dimensional embedding of the natural gas data. By transforming the time series data into it's phase space, I was able to recreate the underlying dynamics. 
A clustering algorithm is then applied to cluster events by its dynamics in the phase space.
